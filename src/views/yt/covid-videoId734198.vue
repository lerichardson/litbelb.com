    <h2 class="cloak-2">Local laws and guidelines</h2>
    <p>This video was filmed entirely in King County of Washington State, which is currently in <a href="https://www.coronavirus.wa.gov/what-you-need-know/county-status-and-safe-start-application-process">phase 3</a>
    of Governor Inslee's <a href="https://coronavirus.wa.gov/what-you-need-know/safe-start/whats-open">Safe Start program.</a> That means that I can have an outdoor social gathering of up to
    50 people outside of my own household, and 10 people while indoors. In addition, State, County, and City-owned outdoor Entertainment establishments are at a maximum of 400 people, or "spectators".
    Masks are also required indoors at all times outside of your home, and outdoors <strong>IF</strong> it is not possible/reasonable to be 6 feet apart. In this video, I interacted with 1 person
    outside of my home, outdoors, with a mask on, meaning I exceeded all guidelines.</p>
